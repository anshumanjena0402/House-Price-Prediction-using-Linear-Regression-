# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

This project presents a Linear Regression–based approach to predicting housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. It systematically demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and performance evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² metrics, along with clear visualization of results in a Jupyter Notebook.
